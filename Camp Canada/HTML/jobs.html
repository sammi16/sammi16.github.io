   <h2>Staff Support</h2>
 </div>

  <p>If you would still like to experience the summer camp experience but don’t feel you would suit a counselor role, or you don’t feel comfortable working directly with the children,
    then maybe the role of Support Staff is more suited for you. Just because you won’t be working directly with the children, it doesn’t mean your job is less important than as a counselor;
    if anything it is more important and this is why you earn more pocket money. The backbone of camp, Support Staff help to keep camp operations running smoothly and efficiently.
    Your job at camp can range from preparing meals and cleaning the kitchen, to office work, maintenance and grounds work.</p>

    <div class="introBox9" id="subheadings">
      <h2>Accomadation</h2>
    </div>

    <p>Support Staff generally share their own housing (cabins, dormitories, or platform tents) with co-workers and do not share a cabin with children.
      During your time off, you are allowed to use the camps facilities if other activities permit this.</p>

      <div class="introBox9" id="subheadings">
        <h2>Food</h2>
      </div>

      <p>Staff and campers eat in what is normally called the Dining Hall.
        Depending on your camp, you get your food from a “buffet” or it is served “family style” (in which platters of food are bought to your table).
        The dining hall is a fun and lively part of camp, with lots of talking, chants, and singing. As Support Staff, we strongly urge you to get involved with the chants and
        singing in the dinning hall, as this will only add to your camp experience.</p>

        <div class="introBox9" id="subheadings">
          <h2>Working Hours And Time Off</h2>
        </div>

        <p>Participants are expected to work a minimum of eight weeks. During this time, there will be at least six full days off from work and a few hours of free time every evening.</p>

           <h2>Camp Counselor</h2>
         </div>

          <p>As a leader, role model, friend, instructor, big brother or sister, cheerleader and hero to campers of varying ages, your primary responsibility is overall supervision. You’re there to ensure their well-being and safety, and make their camp experience more fun and rewarding. There are two types of counselor roles; activities counselor and general counselor. An activities counselor will have their own station to teach/coach the children a specified skill, while a general counselor is more hands on with the children and is more involved with their daily routine.</p>

          <div class="introBox9" id="subheadings">
            <h2>Accommodation</h2>
          </div>

           <p>Most counselors will be living in a cabin or platform tent with a co-counselor and
             8 to 12 campers of similar age. Sometimes cabins have their own bathroom, but it is
             also common for several cabins to share a large centralized bath and shower facility.</p>


             <div class="introBox9" id="subheadings">
               <h2>Food</h2>
             </div>

              <p>Staff and campers eat in what is normally called the Dining Hall.
                Depending on your camp, you get your food from a “buffet” or it is served
                “family style” (in which platters of food are brought to your table).
                 In most cases you will eat with your campers and co-counselors.
                 The dining hall is a fun and lively part of camp, often with lots of talking,
                 chants and singing.</p>

                 <div class="introBox9" id="subheadings">
                   <h2>During The Day</h2>
                 </div>

                  <p>You will fill the role of an Activity or an All-Round/General Counselor
                     depending on your skill level, ability, experience and certification.
                     In either role, you will lead or assist campers of all ages in one or more
                     activities. Your willingness to try everything and anything will be a great
                     asset.</p>

                  <h2>Working Hours And Time Off</h2>
                  </div>

                  <p>Participants are expected to work a minimum of eight weeks.
                     During this time, there will be at least six full days off from work
                     and a few hours of free time every evening.</p>

                     <h2>You Do Not Need To Be A Star Athletes!</h2>
                     </div>

                     <p>The skills and knowledge you already have doing activities in a team,
                       through your school / university or socially with friends are enough to teach at camp.
                       It is sometimes more about the experience of being at camp for the campers than the specific
                       skill being taught.</p>

                       <div class="introBox9" id="subheadings">
                       <h2>Additional Training</h2>
                       </div>

                       <p>Why not improve your skills by enrolling in a refresher course in your home country so you will
                         be able to use these skills and your knowledge to a better degree at camp. Are you a strong swimmer?
                         Then why not consider signing up for a Lifeguard or swim instructor’s course. There are Crisis
                         Intervention certificates you can earn that offer valuable experience at many camps. Many camps may
                         offer certification in a number of skills, consider taking them to further advance yourself
                         professionally</p>
