     <h2>Camp Cambodia!</h2>

            <img src="../IMAGES/Camp-Cambodia.jpg" class="IMAGE">

            <p>Are you ready to embark on the summer experience of a lifetime? Come and discover the adventure of Camp Cambodia!
               Why Camp Cambodia?-Known as ‘the Land of Smiles’ Cambodia is famous for its happy, kind and heart-warming people.
                We have so many fun activities lined up for you to enjoy, however one of Camp Cambodia’s main draws is the chance
                to visit Angkor Wat, the Unesco World Heritage site and one of the Seven Wonders of the World! This is one of the
                 largest religious sites in the world and is truly magnificent. You will also get to experience an ancient way of
                  life by visiting the floating villages by boat on Tonle Sap Lake. Don’t forget a visit to see the local monks,
                   lotus flower farms, night markets, a silk village, majestic waterfalls and the historical site of the Killing Fields.It’s not
                   just sightseeing which is a major draw though. Cambodian cuisine is definitely not to be missed, so be sure to indulge in the
                   local food and nightlife whilst you’re there! As well as this, Siem Reap is popular for the infamous ‘Pub Street’ where you will
                    get to enjoy the best bars and clubs in Cambodia.</p>


                    <p>Make a difference with Camp Cambodia- We’ll be visiting school after school, helping as many children as possible.
                       Our summer camps provide free language classes, visiting primary schools, high schools and orphanages. We engage
                       each child by making everything fun and interactive, using games, activities, songs and sports. This can really
                        make a difference to each child, as a lot of their future employment opportunities will be within tourism. You will
                        also have the chance to get up close and personal with Cambodia’s elephants, with a visit to the local elephant village!
                         Unfortunately, much of the vegetation in areas surrounding Siem Reap has been destroyed, which as a result is affecting
                         the lives of many of Cambodia’s elephants. We will be helping in every way possible to protect and conserve these beautiful
                         creatures.</p>

                         <p>What’s Included?
• Pick up at Phnom Penh airport
• One nights accommodation in Phnom Penh and sight seeing
